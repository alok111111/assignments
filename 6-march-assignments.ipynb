    "   Descriptive Statistics describes the characteristics of a data set. It is a simple technique to describe, show and summarize data in a meaningful wa\n",
    "   You simply choose a group you’re interested in, record data about the group, and then use summary statistics and graphs to describe the group properties. There is no uncertainty involved because you’re just describing the people or items that you actually measure. You’re not aiming to infer properties about a large data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involves taking a potentially sizeable number of data points in the sample data and reducing them to certain meaningful summary values and graphs.\n",
    " The process allows you to obtain insights and visualize the data rather than simply pouring through sets of raw numbers. With descriptive statistics, you can describe both an entire population and an individual sample\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " In Inferential Statistics, the focus is on making predictions about a large group of data based on a representative sample of the population. A random sample of data is considered from a population to describe and make inferences about the population. This technique allows you to work with a small sample rather than the whole population. Since inferential statistics make predictions rather than stating facts, the results are often in the form of probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of inferential statistics depends largely on the accuracy of sample data and how it represents the larger population. This can be effectively done by obtaining a random sample. Results that are based on non-random samples are usually discarded. Random sampling - though not very straightforward always – is extremely important for carrying out inferential techniques\n",
